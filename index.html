<h3>Extra Curricular activities</h3>

<p>
    
    At Irene Christian College, we go beyond traditional academics by offering a comprehensive life skills program designed
    to prepare our students for everyday life. We understand the importance of effective communication and critical
    thinking. That's why Irene Christian College offers engaging opportunities for students to develop their debate and
    public speaking skills. Through our debate club and public speaking events, students are encouraged to express their
    opinions, articulate their thoughts, and engage in meaningful discussions. These activities foster confidence,
    persuasive abilities, and the capacity to think critically and communicate effectively. We prioritize holistic
    development with a focus on social-emotional learning, social etiquette, self-care, wellness, practical life skills,
    communication skills, career guidance, grooming, and deportment. Our comprehensive programs empower students to excel
    academically while equipping them with essential skills for personal growth, professional success, and confident
    navigation of the real world.
